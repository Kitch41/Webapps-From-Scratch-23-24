### Day 1 - Kickoff

Today was the first day of the minor. We were shown what we had to make. It was 2 webapps in 8 days! at first it sounded impossible but once i got working i was fired up. we were put into teams of 4 to 5 people. I was put into one with 4 people total.

We went and setup github and pages. and initiallised our page. Then we went and made some sketches of the webapp we wanted to build. I decided to build a webapp where you can buy pets and put them into your app. there they will walk around and move in a random pattern.

Here are some images of the sketches i made:

They may not make a lot of sense to you but for me this is all i need to start working.

### Day 2 - Continuing, styling, JSON

On day 2 we got working on actually thinking up a team webapp idea. we decided on a temporary idea and to think about it again later.

I also got working on the menu on the side and the shop menu on the bottom. I decided to do this with javascript by moving it into the screen.
The element i used for the side menu is a footer since this made the most sense. For the shop i used a section since it was going to be containing some buttons and other features.

I also wrote some javascript to fetch data from a json file for future use in the teamwebsite. For this i used the source below.
When i wanted to go home i found out that my webapp wasn't properly linked on github pages. The css and js paths were wrong so at home i fixed this issue aswell.
